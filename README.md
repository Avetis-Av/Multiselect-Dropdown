# Multiselect-Dropdown

This is a multiselect dropdown task that I have created using React.js, JSX, and CSS.

Here is how it meets all of the requirements that you have set.
  1) The dropdown works well with large data, you had set the number above 3000, so the current loop
         that creates the array deals with around 4000 items
  2) There is an insert box at the top-center that is set to the default of the length of the array,
         but it can be changed to include any number. The program will throw an error and not let any
         selections occur after the given limit has been reached.
  3) The dropdown is searchable
  4) There are "Select All" and "Deselect All" options for the program that allows the selection of all
         items in the dropdown, given that the limiting value is above the size of the array. If not,
         the program will throw an error message. The "Deselect All" button deselects any number of items
         that have already been selected, whether only one or all of them
  8) There is a default feature of the first item, however this can be changed in the source code
  9) I also added some CSS customizations to the program to make it look more appealing

I hope I met and exceeded your expectations for this project and I look forward to hearing back any 
feedback you have of the code that I have written :)
